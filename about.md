I’m Kiran Scaria, working as a Principal AI Engineer, where I channel my lifelong fascination with artificial intelligence into shaping its future. From machine learning to neural networks, I thrive at the intersection of innovation and impact. Some of my key contributions include:

- **[Raga LLM Hub](https://github.com/raga-ai-hub/raga-llm-hub)**: An open-source library for evaluating LLM pipelines—proof that technology can be both powerful and accessible.
- **[AgentNeo](https://github.com/raga-ai-hub/AgentNeo)**: A Python SDK I developed for Agent AI observability, offering tracing for agents, LLMs, and tools, plus debugging capabilities for multi-agent systems. It features a self-hosted dashboard and advanced analytics with timeline and execution graph views—laying the groundwork for what came next.
- **[Catalyst](https://github.com/raga-ai-hub/RagaAI-Catalyst)**: Building on AgentNeo, this Python SDK elevates Agent AI observability and monitoring with a web-hosted dashboard, enhanced tracing, and a robust evaluation framework. Its advanced analytics, including timeline and execution graph views, empower developers to debug and optimize multi-agentic systems like never before.

For me, technology is more than code and systems—it’s a spark of wonder, a tool for connection, and a gateway to possibilities once thought impossible. As a leader, I’m driven not just to innovate but to inspire, mentoring others to unlock their own potential in the ever-expanding universe of AI.

Beyond the digital realm, I find balance through photography, capturing fleeting moments and timeless landscapes. It’s a different kind of magic—one you can explore at **[my photo blog](https://kiransphotographyblog.wordpress.com)**.

I’m always up for a conversation about AI, tech, photography, or life’s big questions. Let’s connect through the social links below and create something extraordinary together.

`Here’s to making the world a little more magical.`
