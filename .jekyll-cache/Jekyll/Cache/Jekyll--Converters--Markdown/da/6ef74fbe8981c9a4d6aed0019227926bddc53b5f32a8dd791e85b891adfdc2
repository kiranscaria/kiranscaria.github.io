I" <p>Hey there, tech enthusiasts! Remember when we thought ChatGPT was the pinnacle of AI? Well, hold onto your hats, because the AI world never stops spinning, and we’ve got some mind-blowing updates to share!</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-recap-llms-and-stable-diffusion">A Quick Recap: LLMs and Stable Diffusion</h2>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and its successors have been transforming how we interact with text. They’re the brainiacs behind chatbots like ChatGPT, capable of understanding and generating human-like text on almost any topic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Stable Diffusion made waves in 2022 by democratising AI image generation. Suddenly, anyone with a decent GPU could create stunning images from text descriptions. It was a game-changer, to say the least!</p>

<h2 id="the-stable-diffusion-plateau">The Stable Diffusion Plateau</h2>

<p>But here’s the thing – while Stable Diffusion was revolutionary, recent releases have been a bit… underwhelming. Don’t get me wrong, they’re still impressive, but we’ve been seeing some persistent issues. Remember those hilariously mangled hands and fingers in AI-generated images? Yeah, those became quite the meme in the AI art community.</p>

<h2 id="enter-flux-the-new-kid-on-the-block">Enter Flux: The New Kid on the Block</h2>

<p>Just when we thought the text-to-image AI scene might be plateauing, a new player has burst onto the scene: Flux, created by Black Forest Labs. And let me tell you, it’s bringing back the excitement big time!</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-flux-special">What Makes Flux Special?</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Three Flavours of Awesome</strong>: Flux comes in three variants:
    <ul>
      <li>Flux Pro: The powerhouse, available through APIs for serious applications.</li>
      <li>Flux Dev: Open-weight for the tinkerers and experimenters (but not for commercial use).</li>
      <li>Flux Schnell: Open source and available on Hugging Face, perfect for personal projects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Speed Demon</strong>: We’re talking high-quality images in under 2 seconds. That’s lightning fast!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hybrid Architecture</strong>: Flux combines transformers and diffusion models, giving it an edge in both quality and speed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Text Rendering Mastery</strong>: This is where Flux really shines. It’s incredibly good at rendering text in images, opening up a whole new world of possibilities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look at some examples of what Flux can do:</p>

<p><img src="img/posts/from-chatgpt-from-flux/A realistic scene of a running race between an elephant and an ant_flux_pro.jpg" alt="Flux Pro Example: An elephant and ant racing" />
<em>Flux Pro brings the “David vs. Goliath” race to life with stunning detail</em></p>

<p><img src="img/posts/from-chatgpt-from-flux/A realistic scene of a running race between an elephant and an ant_flux_dev.png" alt="Flux Dev Example: An elephant and ant racing" />
<em>Flux Dev keeps up with the pace, showcasing the elephant’s determination and the ant’s sneaky speed</em></p>

<em>Even Flux Schnell doesn’t miss a step, capturing this unlikely duo in a photo finish</em></p>

<p>And for all you pizza lovers out there, feast your eyes on this:</p>

<em>Flux Schnell whipped up this veggie pizza so realistic, you can almost smell the basil!</em></p>

<h3 id="real-world-impact">Real-World Impact</h3>

<p>Imagine being able to generate realistic signage, product mockups with perfect typography, or even entire book covers – all in seconds. For designers, marketers, and content creators, this is a game-changer.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-is-flux-ing-bright">The Future is Flux-ing Bright</h2>

<p>Black Forest Labs isn’t stopping at still images. They’re already working on a text-to-video model. Can you imagine generating high-quality video clips just by typing a description? The potential for content creation is mind-boggling!</p>

<h2 id="why-you-should-be-excited">Why You Should Be Excited</h2>

<p>Flux isn’t just another incremental improvement – it’s breathing new life into the field of AI-generated imagery. It’s addressing some of the persistent issues we’ve seen with other models (goodbye, creepy hands!) and opening up new possibilities we haven’t even thought of yet.</p>

<p>However, it’s important to note that there’s still room for improvement. Take a look at this example:</p>

<p><img src="img/posts/from-chatgpt-from-flux/out-0-33.webp" alt="Flux Schnell Area for Improvement: A mummified angel with red wings" />
<em>While Flux has made great strides, there’s still room for improvement. This mummified angel seems to have gained an extra arm. Maybe it’s the latest heavenly fashion trend?</em></p>

<p>As you can see, while Flux has significantly improved upon previous models, there are still some challenges when it comes to rendering very complex structures or extremely intricate details. But hey, who are we to judge angelic fashion choices? This just goes to show that the field of AI-generated imagery is still evolving, and we can expect even more exciting (and hopefully less anatomically confusing) developments in the future!</p>

<h2 id="want-to-try-it-out">Want to Try It Out?</h2>

<p>If you’re itching to get your hands on Flux, you’re in luck! The Flux Schnell model is available for anyone to experiment with. Here are some resources to get you started:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>: Check out <a href="https://github.com/camenduru/flux-jupyter">this GitHub repository</a> for a Jupyter notebook that lets you generate images with Flux right in your browser.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fine Tuning Guide</strong>: If you’re ready to dive deeper, here’s a <a href="https://github.com/bghira/SimpleTuner/blob/main/documentation/quickstart/FLUX.md">quick start guide on fine tuning Flux Schnell</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Note on Hardware Requirements</strong>: Fine Tuning Flux is pretty resource-intensive. When training every component of the model, a rank-16 LoRA uses a bit more than 40GB of VRAM. You’ll need at minimum a single A40 GPU, or ideally, multiple A6000s. Don’t worry if you don’t have this hardware at home – cloud providers like TensorDock offer these GPUs at very affordable rates (less than $2/hour).</p>
