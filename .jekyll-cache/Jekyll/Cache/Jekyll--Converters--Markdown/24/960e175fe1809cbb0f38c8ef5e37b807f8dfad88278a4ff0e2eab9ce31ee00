I"ñ<p>Iâ€™m Kiran Scaria, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tech Lead</code> at <a href="https://raga.ai">Raga AI</a>, where I channel my lifelong fascination with artificial intelligence into shaping its future. From machine learning to neural networks, I thrive at the intersection of innovation and impact. Some of my key contributions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/raga-ai-hub/raga-llm-hub">Raga LLM Hub</a></strong>: An open-source library for evaluating LLM pipelinesâ€”proof that technology can be both powerful and accessible.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/raga-ai-hub/AgentNeo">AgentNeo</a></strong>: A Python SDK I developed for Agent AI observability, offering tracing for agents, LLMs, and tools, plus debugging capabilities for multi-agent systems. It features a self-hosted dashboard and advanced analytics with timeline and execution graph viewsâ€”laying the groundwork for what came next.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/raga-ai-hub/RagaAI-Catalyst">Catalyst</a></strong>: Building on AgentNeo, this Python SDK elevates Agent AI observability and monitoring with a web-hosted dashboard, enhanced tracing, and a robust evaluation framework. Its advanced analytics, including timeline and execution graph views, empower developers to debug and optimize multi-agentic systems like never before.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, technology is more than code and systemsâ€”itâ€™s a spark of wonder, a tool for connection, and a gateway to possibilities once thought impossible. As a leader, Iâ€™m driven not just to innovate but to inspire, mentoring others to unlock their own potential in the ever-expanding universe of AI.</p>

<p>Beyond the digital realm, I find balance through photography, capturing fleeting moments and timeless landscapes. Itâ€™s a different kind of magicâ€”one you can explore at <strong><a href="https://kiransphotographyblog.wordpress.com">my photo blog</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m always up for a conversation about AI, tech, photography, or lifeâ€™s big questions. Letâ€™s connect through the social links below and create something extraordinary together.</p>
