I"$<p>I am <strong>Kiran Scaria</strong>, a Principal AI Engineer focused on building dependable AI systems that ship and hold up in production.</p>

<p>Most of my work sits at the intersection of agent frameworks, memory systems, observability, and evaluation. I use this blog as an engineering journal: what worked, what failed, and what I would improve next.</p>

<p>If you are new here, start with the <a href="/posts/">latest posts</a> for current implementation notes.</p>
