        <h2>Project Vision</h2>
        <p>This project aims to develop an AI system that can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand software requirements from natural language descriptions</li>
          <li>Design appropriate system architectures</li>
          <li>Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code</li>
          <li>Test and debug its own implementations</li>
          <li>Refactor and optimize existing codebases</li>
        </ul>

<p>For too long, I've been sitting on the banks, watching a stream of ideas flow through me. I've toyed with many of them; pondered, tinkered, and even brought a few close to completion; but I've always stepped back before they could fully take shape. None have crossed the finish line.</p>

<p>Now, I'm ready to commit. I've chosen an idea that feels revolutionary, one I suspect many others are already chasing. It burst into the spotlight about a year ago when Devin's demo video took the internet by storm. Since then, a wave of similar tools  - like Lovable, Windsurf, Cursor and many more have emerged, some of which I use regularly. I've been impressed, some more than others, but I still feel the dream of a true AI Software Engineer remains out of reach. It's a concept that excites people, and I want to take my shot at it. So, starting now, I'm diving into building my own AI Software Engineer.</p>

<p>Let me lay out my vision clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a passion project I'll tackle in my spare time, so progress will be slow.</li>
<li>It's a solo endeavor - just me and the code.</li>
<li>Will it be open source? I'd love for it to be, but I'll decide that once I've built something stable.</li>
<li>My priority is correctness - ensuring the code it produces is reliable - over speed or cost-efficiency.</li>
<li>The goal? An AI Software Engineer that outshines human coders in most tasks, with the ability to grow: learning from mistakes, mastering new frameworks, and adapting to new languages.</li>
<li>I'll document this journey right here on this blog.</li>
<li>Profit isn't the aim. I want to push the boundaries of what's possible with today's LLMs and tech, creating the best AI Software Engineer I can.</li>
<li>I'll document this journey right here on this blog, sharing wins, setbacks, and everything in between.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a massive undertaking, and I know it'll be tough. But that challenge sparks a thrilling mix of joy and trepidation, like standing on the edge of a cliff, heart racing, knowing the leap could change everything. When I use tools like the ones I mentioned, I can't shake the feeling they could be better. This is my chance to stop letting ideas slip away, to wade into the river and build something real.</p>
